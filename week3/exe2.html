    <h1>Hallo, My Name is Foong Kuan Zi!</h1>
    <h3 class="quote">
        This time you overdid the liquor, this time you pulled the fuckin' trigger; These days you're rolling all the
        time, so low so you keep getting high.
    </h3>
    <p>
        You may call me "Magpierre", or just "Pierre" for short! I typically like to introduce myself with a certain
        nickname, you see... It keeps everything neat and tidy, and allows me to instantly know where I know you from!
        (If you know me from high school or for my translation work, I'm sure you know me as "Kayoko".) I'm unable to
        differenciate faces (I can perceive you as you are, it just doesn't register properly), so this system helps me
        to save face and time, LOL.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since we're here, I might as well tell you about all of <i>my favourite things</i>. This doesn't come as a
        surprise, especially if you already know me in real life, but I'm an avid fan of watching and documenting these
        <a href="https://streetcat.wiki/index.php/Hello_Street_Cat" class="link">stray cats from China</a>. It's kind of
        the first thing (and usually the only thing) I talk about when I meet someone new, like a good bonding
        experience, you know? Just like how some people instinctively trust dog lovers, I instinctively trust in cat
        lovers to not be an asshole. (Even if the common conception is that they resemble the cats they own -- AKA that
        they're also rude and stuck up.)
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, I'm a great fan (and I would like to think, a great player) of <a
            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devsisters.gb&hl=en&pli=1" class="link"> Cookie Run:
            Ovenbreak</a>. I tend to become obsessive over the things I am interested in (insert the cat documentation
        thing as mentioned above), which also includes wanting my profile in CROB (short for Cookie Run: Ovenbreak) to
        look as good as possible. I'm currently in the #48 guild worldwide and am in the top 2.6% of players in <a
            href=https://cookierun.fandom.com/wiki/Trophy_Race class="link">Trophy Race</a> (one of the more competitive
        modes in-game). There's also several certificates I've received in-game to decorate my profile with, but the
        only two I put are my top #406 Crop Snatchers certificate and the top 3.255% Team Fight certificate I
        received alongside my friend, Wistelia, around June of this year. The others are frankly too embarrassing to
        even be considered, LOL.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyways, that should be all about me, I think! There's a lot more I can go on a tangent about but I think it
        would be best to keep this <i>Short n' Sweet</i>. See you!
