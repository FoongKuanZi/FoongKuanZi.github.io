                        At the cat shelter where I work we refer to "naughty torties" and "laid back blacks". One of our
                        vets also used
                        the "naughty tortie" epithet and told us it is "well known that tortie cats are temperamental".
                        However, the
                        addition of white has a "calming effect" and tortie-and-whites are "not quite as temperamental
                        as brindled
                        torties. The naughty tortie tag is not applied to dilute torties (blue-creams), possibly because
                        they are less
                        common in the moggy population. Ginger cats are said to be spirited and fiery (and sometimes
                        mean-spirited or
                        sly) - very apt considering their fiery colour and there is the epithet "ginger tom" to describe
                        the supposedly
                        typical alley cat. Blotched tabbies are "real homebodies" while their striped cousins are "more
                        independent".
                    </p>
                    <p>Common stereotypes are the "archetypal ginger tom" - the flea-bitten, irascible alley cat.
                        Ginger
                        females are "flighty". Confusingly, ginger cats are also quoted as being laid back, but they
                        supposedly have very hot tempers when annoyed - just like the stereotype of human red-heads,
                        especially those of fiery Celtic origin (which would include me). Oddly enough, ginger
                        colouration in cats is relatively common in Scotland. A fiery or assertive temperament might be
                        an advantage in some environments - for both cats and humans! Meanwhile, blotched tabbies of
                        either gender are considered "comfortable, home-loving" cats; languid and good pets. Many cards
                        depict tabby cats curled up by a fire as a symbol of domestic warmth and comfort. Black and
                        white cats are said to be wanderers while white cats are shy or nervy.

    <p class="catintro">How much of this is myth and how much is a cat's colour and pattern linked to personality?
        Both are, after all, inherited and genetically controlled, so it is not impossible for coat colour to
        be linked to temperament. We selectively breed cats for their looks, but seldom for personality.
        Coat colour, fur type and certain personality traits may be linked genetically. In some rodents,
        the white colour is associated with greater docility and increased tolerance of handling which
        may be why white mice and white rats are common laboratory animals.

            <h2 class="titleinfo">Early Opinions on Colour
            </h2>
            <p>Dr Gordon Stables, in 1872, firmly attributed different characters to felines of differing coat colours.
                In
                his list of classes at the Birmingham and Crystal Palace shows he described the exhibits. His
                description of
                the Red Tabby in class V read; "The Red Tabby ought to approach in size and shape, nearly to the Brown.
                They
                are the same kind-hearted, good-natured animals as their brown brethren, and as a rule are better
                hunters.
                They go farther afield and tackle larger game. They are often, moreover, very expert fishers." (Cats
                are, in
                general, enthusiastic rather than expert fishers.) In the Red "Urbanity of countenance not to be
                overlooked". Meanwhile, of the Brown Tabby he wrote that they "possess all pussy s noblest attributes to
                perfection! They are docile, honest and faithful ... seldom take undue advantage of their great
                strength".
                According to Gordon Stables in 1872, there was a tradition that white cats were favoured as mousers by
                millers as they did not show up against the flour bags.</p>

            <p>R S Huidekoper in his book, The Cat (1895) wrote of colours and temperaments. Of the black-and-white
                biclour
                he wrote " It tends more than any other cat to become fat and indolent, or ragged and wretched, as the
                case
                may be. [...] The Black and White cat is affectionate and cleanly, but it is a selfish animal, and is
                not
                one for children to play with." Huidekoper went on to claim that the gene which caused a cat to have
                white
                markings was also responsible for a drastic deterioration in temperament: "The Tortoiseshell and White
                [...]
                is apt to become lazy when old - the more so the more white there is in its markings. These cats are
                excessively cleanly, and vain of their white, spending much of their time in keeping themselves clean."
                A
                tortoiseshell without any white, however was "one of the best hunters [...] a most patient mouser, and
                is
                brave to the extreme. It is not over affectionate, and sometimes even sinister and most ill-tempered in
                its
                disposition."</p>

            <p>An all-white cat was "of a timid disposition, very fond of petting and cuddling, it is quiet in its
                manners,
                delicate in its temperament, and honest in its character. It would much prefer to be fed from the
                saucer,
                and from the table while lying on a chair, than go roaming for prey or stealing from the kitchen. White
                Cats
                are, however, sometimes excellent mousers, and are especially popular pets with millers, as their colour
                can
                scarcely be seen among the sacks of Hour. White Cats are often deaf, and sometimes blind, without any
                appearance of organic change in the eyes."</p>

            <p>In 1981, Phyllis Lauder wrote, "I bred a nice Tortoiseshell kitten who, in fact, won her open class at
                the
                Southern Cat Club s Show in London, and an older colleague asked me 'Does she play with water?' I
                admitted
                with surprise that this kitten dearly loved a tap left dripping and would sit hitting droplets of water
                with
                her paws. 'Tortoiseshells always do,' said my friend quite seriously, and I realised with surprise that
                of
                the many kittens I had bred this, the only Tortoiseshell, was also the only one who played with water."
            </p>

            <p>Adding another layer of confusion to the colour/temperament argument is the idiosyncratic British system
                of
                classifying breeds! Under the British GCCF, the Blue Persian, White Persian and Red Persian etc are all
                different breeds. This meant that differnt colours were developed at different rates (something which
                was
                noticeable in Chinchilla Persians for a long while being less ultra-typed than the blue or red
                Persians).
                Temperament traits may well have become fixed in some lines as breeders attempted to get the best colour
                and
                accidentally bred in docility - or the opposite - at the same time! This may be why I have such
                differing
                opinions from the USA where the colour classification system is generally rather more sensible.</p>

            <h2 class="titleinfo">Fiery Redheads?
            </h2>
            <p>How did Cats with red and cream coats get their reputation for being "difficult"? It seems partly due
                to
                an erroneous conclusion from a behavioural study conducted in Edinburgh by Rebecca Ledger and
                Valerie
                O'Farrell, "Factors Influencing the Reactions of Cats to Humans and Novel Objects," published in the
                Proceedings of the 30th International Congress of the International Society for Applied Ethology
                (Guelph: Col. K. L. Campbell Centre for the Study of Animal Welfare, 1996), 112.</p>

            <p>Their study aimed to identify temperament differences in kittens and factors which influenced their
                behavioural responses to an unfamiliar person, handling, an alarm clock and a clockwork mouse. The
                behavioural responses of 29 litters of pedigree British Shorthair kittens (84 kittens) and their
                parents, were scored to these tests. These cats and kittens were from the Edinburgh area of
                Scotland;
                this made it likely that they were related because several breeders would have been choosing the
                same
                prize-winning stud cats for their females. The researchers found that kittens with red or cream coat
                colour (indicating the presence of the red coat colour gene), made the most escape attempts when
                handled
                by an unfamiliar person and struggled for a longer time compared to kittens which did not carry the
                red
                coat gene. They were unable to correlate the behavioural responses of fathers and their kittens so
                they
                simply concluded that "cats without red coats are less fearful and more handleable than cats with
                red
                coats."</p>

            <p>According to John Bradshaw in his book "Cat Sense" (2013), scientists were able to trace this back to
                one male with a particularly difficult temperament. To this I will add that this male, almost
                certainly
                red, passed on his temperament genes along with his colour and this could have been inherited
                through
                the mothers (there was a correlation between mothers' and kittens' behaviour). By restricting
                themselves
                to one breed to eliminate random factors, the researchers introduced an obfuscating factor (a common
                ancestor with a poor temperament) and reached an incorrect conclusion! They may also have been led
                into
                this conclusion, and not sought other factors (a common ancestor), through subconscious bias about
                cats
                with red or tortie coats.</p>

            <h2 class="titleinfo">Temperament & Intelligence
                of the Turkish Vankedisi
            </h2>
            <p>Turkish Vankedisi are extremely intelligent and curious cats. They have a nerdy side to them that
                enjoys
                exploring and learning new things. Their love for learning makes them quite trainable, and they can
                develop a hobby of learning new tricks and growing an impressive repertoire. Because they’re so
                active,
                they’re recommended for people who can keep up with their silly antics and provide plenty of
                exercise
                opportunities for them. Turkish Vankedisi may even learn to walk on a leash and enjoy exploring the
                outdoors regularly.</p>
            <p>
                This breed is known to be affectionate and develop strong bonds with one or two people in their
                families. However, Turkish Vankedisi show affection in their own ways. They’ll tolerate cuddles and
                being petted, but they’re usually not lap cats. They prefer showing their love by spending time and
                playing with their favorite people. They’ll also follow you from room to room and stay close by your
                side, even if they don’t want to be touched. Although they’re not cuddly lap cats, Turkish Vankedisi
                like being around their family members and don’t usually tolerate being alone for long hours.
                Therefore,
                they do best in families where someone is usually around or with people who work from home. </p>

                </h2>
                <p>Turkish Vankedisi are friendly and confident cats. They usually enjoy being around children, and
                    they
                    can become good playmates because of their love for running around and having fun. Since they
                    don’t
                    always enjoy being touched, it’s important to teach children how to interact with them and
                    respect
                    their boundaries. Turkish Vankedisi will also appreciate having a couple of high perches that
                    children can’t reach so that they can retreat to these spaces when they want to rest without any
                    disruptions.</p>

                <p>It’s very possible for Turkish Vankedisi to learn to coexist with other pets. They do well in
                    homes
                    with cat-friendly dogs, and they can also enjoy living with other cats. It may be a little more
                    challenging if you have smaller pets in the home, like reptiles, birds, small mammals, and fish.
                    Their curiosity often gets the better of them, and they can end up frightening or hurting small
                    pets.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>Turkish Vankedisi are generally healthy cats that don’t require special diets. They usually
                        do
                        well eating high-quality commercial cat food. It’s best to communicate with your
                        veterinarian to
                        determine meal proportions so that your Turkish Vankedisi is eating enough to sustain their
                        active lifestyle.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your Turkish Vankedisi may benefit from taking supplements with omega fatty acids to keep
                        their
                        luxurious coats healthy and soft. These types of supplements can also support joint and
                        mobility
                        health as Turkish Vankedisi age. Turkish Vankedisi only benefit from supplements if they’re
                        absolutely necessary, so make sure to consult your veterinarian before you add any type of
                        supplement to their diet.

                    <h2 class="titleinfo">Exercise
                    </h2>
                    <p>Turkish Vankedisi need to exercise multiple times throughout the day. Playing with them is an
                        excellent way to keep them active, and many enjoy pouncing on cat wands and chasing balls.
                        They
                        also like to climb, so it’s important to have at least one cat tree in the house. Installing
                        window perches or cat balconies can keep Turkish Vankedisi entertained as they observe the
                        outside world from a safe location.</p>
                    <p>Turkish Vankedisi may also learn to wear a harness and walk on a leash. If you want to take
                        your
                        Turkish Vankedisi on a walk, make sure they’re taking preventative parasite medication and
                        that
                        they’re not spending too much time outside on hot, sunny days. They have sensitive skin
                        that’s
                        prone to sunburn, so it’s important to break up time outside into shorter sessions and
                        ensure
                        they have time to rest in shaded areas.</p>

                        </h2>
                        <p>Turkish Vankedisi are smart cats, and they learn to use litter boxes quickly. They’re
                            also
                            relatively fast at learning new tricks. If you keep training sessions short and fun and
                            use
                            tasty treats, you’ll find that Turkish Vankedisi are enthusiastic students who can learn
                            a
                            variety of tricks.

                        </h2>
                        <p>Turkish Vankedisi are generally healthy cats, but they’re also prone to deafness. This
                            congenital deafness occurs at birth, and cats can either have partial or full deafness.
                            Other than deafness, Turkish Vankedisi are prone to developing the same health issues as
                            Turkish Vans as they age.

                    <h2 class="titleinfo">Grooming
                    </h2>
                    <p>Despite having a long coat, Turkish Vankedisi have fairly minimal grooming needs. Their hair
                        isn’t prone to matting, but they’ll benefit from weekly brushing to lift dead hair from
                        their
                        coat. Turkish Vankedisi do have a shedding season as they reveal their summer coat. You can
                        brush their coat more frequently during this time to reduce shedding in the home and lower
                        the
                        occurrences of coughing up hairballs. </p>
                    <p>Turkish Vans don’t require baths unless they get really dirty or if their coat starts to
                        develop
                        a greasy texture. Sometimes, Turkish Vans will need baths as they get older and start to
                        experience difficulty with grooming themselves.</p>
