    <p class="catintro">
        The Japanese Bobtail Longhair is a beautiful cat breed with a distinct tail—or, rather, lack thereof—that
        sets it apart from most other cats. This short tail is a mutation caused by the expression of a dominant
        gene. The gene is fixed for this breed, so generally, all kittens born to even a single Japanese Bobtail
        parent will have a stubby tail, too.

                Origin & History
            </h2>
            <p>Legend says that the Japanese Bobtail is an ancient cat breed that was initially given to Japan’s emperor
                over 1,000 years ago. However, its true origin story remains a mystery.</p>

            <p>
                The breed wasn’t seen outside of Japan until the 1960s when American breeders set their eyes on these
                beautiful kitties and took matters into their own hands. The short-haired variety earned Championship
                status from the Cat Fanciers’ Association in 1976, but the longhair didn’t achieve the same status until
                1993.

            <h2 class="titleinfo">Temperament & Intelligence
                of the Japanese Bobtail Longhair
            </h2>
            <p>The Japanese Bobtail Longhair is a highly active and intelligent breed. They’re textbook extroverts and
                will happily spend their day “talking” to you with their expansive vocabularies of meows and chirps.
                These cats are very people-oriented and thrive in households with active families that prioritize
                playtime. Japanese Bobtails are so friendly and outgoing that they won’t have a problem greeting
                strangers like old friends. Because they genuinely love connection, they want to be involved in
                everything going on around the home.</p>

            <p>
                When they’re not busy playing or following their humans around the home, Japanese Bobtail Longhairs keep
                themselves occupied by exploring every nook and cranny. These clever kitties will find a way to climb on
                top of your kitchen cupboards to investigate and aren’t afraid to scale your bookshelves to get a better
                view of their home.

                <h2 class="titleinfo">Are These Cats Good for Families?
                </h2>
                <p>The Japanese Bobtail Longhair can make an excellent companion for homes with children. They’re so
                    easygoing that they can thrive in nearly any household, whether it’s a bustling home with five kids
                    or a more relaxed environment.</p>
                <p>
                    Because they’re so people-oriented and extroverted, Japanese Bobtail Longhair cats get along with
                    pretty much anyone. They’ll happily play with your kids, but they’re also content with kicking back
                    and relaxing for movie night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it may be better to wait to adopt a furry companion if your children are very young or
                    don’t have the capacity to learn and respect boundaries just yet. As extroverted as Japanese Bobtail
                    Longhair cats are, they still enjoy moments of independence and won’t enjoy living with someone who
                    doesn’t respect their need for time alone. </p>

                <p>Japanese Bobtail Longhairs aren’t only social toward their human family members, but they can get
                    along swimmingly with other feline housemates, too. Their easygoing and adaptable temperament also
                    means that these kitties can share their living space with canine family members. However, it’s
                    essential to follow a proper introduction period when bringing a new animal into the home.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>Healthy Japanese Bobtail Longhair cats have the same food and diet requirements as any other cat
                        breed.
                    </p>
                    <p>Cats should eat a commercially prepared diet that’s labeled as “complete and balanced” for their
                        life stage. Growing kittens have different nutritional requirements than their adult
                        counterparts, so make sure you’re feeding your kitty food labeled for “growth.” Once they’re 12
                        months old, they can slowly transition to an adult diet labeled for “maintenance.”
                    </p>
                    <p>As obligate carnivores, cats need a diet high in animal protein. A good rule of thumb is that any
                        food you offer your kitty should have a real protein listed as the first ingredient.

                    <p>While cats’ exercise needs aren’t as high as their canine counterparts, they still require
                        physical activity to be healthy and happy. Japanese Bobtail Longhair cats love to play and
                        explore, so owners should capitalize on their kitty’s curiosity and knack for adventure.</p>
                    <p>Their ideal environment includes window perches for surveying their territory outside the home,
                        cat trees for watching over their indoor territory, and scratching posts for satisfying their
                        innate desire to scratch.</p>

                        <p>Because they’re so people-oriented, Japanese Bobtail Longhairs are very eager to please their
                            owners. For this reason, they can be taught to walk on a leash and perform tricks. Just make
                            sure you have some yummy, high-value treats on hand to reward them for a job well done.

                        </h2>
                        <p>While the Japanese Bobtail Longhair is a relatively healthy cat breed, these kitties may be
                            prone to developing many of the same health conditions that affect other breeds.
                        </p>
                        <p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most commonly diagnosed heart disease in cats. It
                            causes the walls in a cat’s heart to thicken, ultimately decreasing its efficiency.
                        </p>
                        <p>Like other cats, Japanese Bobtail Longhairs are likely to develop some form of dental
                            disease. However, proper dental hygiene can largely prevent these issues.
                        </p>
                        <p>Ensuring your kitty is fed the right diet in proper portions and has plenty of opportunities
                            for exercise and play can help prevent obesity, another extremely common (and preventable)
                            condition in cats.

                    <h2 class="titleinfo">Grooming
                    </h2>
                    <p>As with all cats, the Japanese Bobtail Longhair tackles much of their grooming themselves.
                        They’re very fastidious, but that doesn’t mean they don’t require some help from you. Owners
                        should expect to do some coat maintenance a few times per week for optimal coat health.</p>
                    <p>Insight into this breed’s grooming regimen is evident right there in its name—Japanese
                        Bobtail Longhair. These cats have long coats that require regular maintenance to keep them
                        looking their best. You’ll want to invest in a few grooming tools, such as a metal comb for
                        detangling and a bladed brush for removing mats. Thankfully, their silky textured coat doesn’t
                        mat or tangle too easily.</p>
                    <p>Since Japanese Bobtails don’t have undercoats, they don’t shed much other than during seasonal
                        coat changes.</p>
                    <p>Nail care is another essential aspect of cat ownership that you can’t skimp out on. Though your
                        kitty will sharpen their claws on their cat tree (or your favorite furniture if you don’t
                        provide them with places to scratch), you may need to step in and trim their nails if they get
                        too long.</p>
                    <p>Dental hygiene is an often skipped-over part of the grooming regimen, but it can reduce your
                        pet’s likelihood of developing dental disease, so it’s worth learning how to do it.</p>
