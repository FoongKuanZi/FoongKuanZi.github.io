                    <h1>How old is my cat?</h1>
                    <p>Are you curious about your kitten's age? Understanding your kitten's age is important because it
                        helps in determining how to take care of them. Different age groups require different kinds of
                        attention, especially when it comes to things like feeding, grooming, and keeping them warm. In
                        this comprehensive illustrated guide, "How Old Is My Kitten?" we're going to help you figure it
                        out.</p>
                    <p>It can be hard to tell a kitten's age just by looking, but we've got some clues that might help.
                        We will discuss kitten behavior, physical growth, and health to help you guess their age.
                        But remember, the best way to find out is to ask a vet or a professional. What we provide is a
                        rough guide, which can help you understand your kitten better.</p>

                <h2>Comparing Feline To Human Age</h2>
                <p>Cat owners often wonder how their cat compares to humans when it comes to age. Is being 7 years
                    considered old for a cat? How about 14? How old is my cat in human years?</p>
                <p>The average lifespan of humans in developed countries is around 80 years old. For cats, it's around
                    15.
                    However, cats mature faster than humans do. So, at six months old, a kitten is not as helpless as a
                    toddler would be at age three. Refer to our infographic above about your own cat.</p>
                <p>So, is 7 considered old for a cat? If by "old" you mean elderly, then not just yet. Most cats can
                    still be considered as being in the prime of their life at that age.
                    However, many veterinarians consider cats to be elderly or "seniors" at 8-10 years. Any older and
                    your cat can officially be considered an "old-timer".</p>
                <p>Just like with people, individual cats age at different rates regardless of their biological age.
                    Talk to your veterinarian and work out an adequate care routine that works for your kitty.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>How Do Cats Age?</h2>
                <p>Genetics and heredity play an important part in a cat's life. If as a kitten, there was plentiful
                    food and water, indoor living, and veterinary care, a cat will be larger and healthier than a
                    feral kitten whose mother was malnourished and unable to provide proper nutrition for the
                    kittens.
                </p>
                <p>If a cat is past the cutesy kitten stage but is obviously not fully mature, chances are he's a
                    year or two old. In human terms, a year-old cat is comparable to a fifteen-year-old teenager
                    which explains the bursts of energy followed by long naps.</p>
                <p>At age twenty, the cat is geriatric and comparable to a ninety-six-year-old human—even longer naps
                    and rare energy bursts. As with any other species, cats slow down as they age. Jumping is natural
                    for cats. So, if the cat you've adopted isn't comfortable jumping onto the bed, chances are he's
                    older than you first thought.</p>
                <p>Pet steps or a footstool will give him mobility without added stress. With less exercise, comes
                    weight gain as well. A heavier cat can be older too—or being overweight has slowed a normally active
                    cat.</p>
                <p>Just like with humans, the saying goes, “Before beginning a diet and exercise program, be sure to be
                    examined by your veterinarian to make sure you're healthy enough to make the changes needed to lose
                    weight, improve health and gain mobility.”</p>
                <p>Indoor cats live much longer than feral, outdoor cats. This is because they have no predators to
                    avoid, good quality food, fresh water, and a family to call their own. These factors will extend a
                    cat's life.</p>
                <p>The average indoor cat lives twelve to fifteen years. However, with constantly improved
                    veterinary care, twenty and even more can now be an attainable goal.</p>

                    <h2>Kittens' Eye Development</h2>
                    <p>When kittens are born, they are blind and their eyes are shut. After about a week or so, they
                        open their eyes. At ten days, the eyes should be fully open.
                    </p>
                    <p>Eye color is another indicator of a kitten's age. All kittens are born with blue eyes. The color
                        gradually changes as they grow and at as early as seven weeks (in most breeds and mixed breeds),
                        the color begins to change.</p>
                    <p>Some breeds take longer for eye color to become permanent and sometimes, it's just hard to tell
                        the color—kittens don't hold still long enough to get a good look!</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <!--box 3-->
            <div class="box">

                    <div><img src="img/catpaw.png" alt="cat paw" height="35"></div>
                    <h2>When Do Kittens Start Teething?</h2>
                    <p>Kittens' teeth, specifically their incisors or canine teeth, start appearing around three or four
                        weeks. Lower molars come in at four to five weeks, while upper molars show up around eight
                        weeks.
                    </p>
                    <p>Kittens can start eating solid food as early as five weeks. If a kitten is searching for the food
                        bowl instead of waiting for food to be brought to it, that's a sign it's a bit older.</p>
