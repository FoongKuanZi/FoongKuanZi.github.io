    <h1>Hallo, my name is Foong Kuan Zi!</h1>
    <p>My hobby is documenting stray cats in China, specifcally cats from the <a
            href="https://streetcat.wiki/index.php/Hello_Street_Cat">Hello Street Cat service</a>. My favourite cat is
        <a href="https://streetcat.wiki/index.php/Mrs._Dress">Mrs. Dress</a>, whom I lovingly call my "Big Fat
        BaoZilla". Other than my absurd obsession with stray cats, I'm also an avid fan of playing <a
            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devsisters.gb&hl=en&pli=1"> Cookie Run:
            Ovenbreak</a>. I am currently in the Rainbow 3 rank, and also in the #40 guild worldwide.
    </p>
    <p> I also occasionally play this one Warrior Cat inspired generator, called ClanGen. I use it to create a
        basis for stories to write in my free time, with my current one being inspired from cults! It's being used as an
        exercise for me to test out how to write "understandable" and/or "realistic" characters, so I find it fun to
        leave it all up to chance.
    </p>
    <p>Anyone who knows me also knows that Glass Animals is my favourite band of all time! They recently released a new
        album and I've been listening to it quite a bit:</p>

    <h5> P.S.: My favourite song in it is <a href="https://youtu.be/9-LI98Q-rsg?si=6OLOspiqkXd4ozL-">"A Tear In Space
            (Airlock)"</a>, but I think <a href="https://youtu.be/sm3PbXKSv40?si=x4agxxxY1BoF3JJ2">"Wonderful
            Nothing"</a> is pretty good
        too.</h5>
